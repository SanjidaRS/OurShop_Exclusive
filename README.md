# Our Shop Exclusive

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Overview

**Our Shop Exclusive** is a modern e-commerce website built using Next.js. It showcases a range of products, offering a user-friendly shopping experience with features such as product detail pages, a shopping cart, and a checkout process. The site is designed to provide an intuitive and seamless experience for users looking to explore and purchase exclusive products.


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Features
**Product Listings:** View a diverse range of products with detailed descriptions, images, and pricing.
**Product Detail Pages:** Access in-depth information about each product, including specifications and high-quality images.
**Shopping Cart:** Add products to your cart, view cart details, and proceed to checkout.
**Responsive Design:** Optimized for various devices and screen sizes to ensure a smooth user experience on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
**Search and Filter:** Easily find products using search functionality and filter options.
**Secure Checkout:** Complete purchases with a secure and straightforward checkout process.

## Technologies Used
**Next.js:** Framework for building server-side rendered React applications.
